After completing the assignment, please answer the questions in this text file and submit it to I-Learn.

1. Project Title / One sentence description:

Halo Merchandise Store
A place where you can buy Halo merchandise all across the webs without having to browse through every website store that exists: It is all consolidated in one place!

2. The Heroku URL for your web application:

https://enigmatic-bastion-35195.herokuapp.com/HaloMerchandise/browseItems.php

3. The GitHub URL for your source code repository:

https://github.com/eversolea/cs313-php/tree/master/web/HaloMerchandise

4. A link to the SQL file that contains the commands used to create your tables (e.g. a link to the myDb.sql file at GitHub, or something similar).

https://github.com/eversolea/cs313-php/blob/master/web/HaloMerchandise/inclassExample.sql

The addition of items is shown at the bottom of this .sql page. I did not find the exact .sql code I used to make the tables, but it is very similar to what is shown in this .sql file.

5. Please provide a brief description of what your project does and how to use the application. Make sure to include any required information like a username and password.

To use this application, you will want to start at Browse Items. Find an item that you would like to buy. Add it to your cart! You can add multiple items if you so wish.
Then go to View Cart (Either with the Cart icon on the navbar, or the "View Cart" link on the Navbar). Make sure Everything there is correct. Then you can Check out your items! It will take you to the check out page.
At the check out page, you can enter your address information. Then continue to the next page, which will show you the confirmation page with your address and cart information so you can ensure everything is correct. If you bought an item you didn't want, contact us and we will fix it for you!
You can also add a new item to the database. With great power comes great responsibility! But we trust you because Halo fans are very close and loving. Choose which category you want to add your item to, then fill out the information and add it! If you made a mistake, dont worry: you can delete it at the bottom of the page. If you don't catch your mistake, one of our team members wil be checking the Item Database so we will fix it for you.


6. Briefly describe any pieces of the assignment that are not yet working correctly.

Everything works great! Deleting an item from your cart would be a nice functionality if the user added one by accident. Users can reset thier cart by accessing the confirmation page, but that isn't intuitive.

Project Self-assessment
--------------------------------

For each of the following requirements, please replace the "(YES/NO)" with either "YES" or "NO" as to whether or not your work met this requirement.

Requirements
------------
YES (YES/NO) 1. Your web application is running in Heroku.
YES (YES/NO) 2. Your latest source code is in GitHub.
YES (YES/NO) 3. Your web application uses data stored in the session.
YES (YES/NO) 4. Your web application uses a PostgreSQL database at Heroku.
USES MULTIPLE TABLES: SO YES? (YES/NO) 5. Your database schema includes foreign key references.
NO: But its best for me not to because I want to display attributes from each table/category differently. (YES/NO) 6. Your web application includes an SQL SELECT query that joins multiple tables.
YES (YES/NO) 7. Your web application includes an SQL UPDATE or INSERT statement.

For each of the following criteria, please replace the "(A-E)" with either the "A", "B", "C", "D", or "E" category you feel best describes your work.

Categories
----------
A - Some attempt was made.
B - Developing, but significantly deficient.
C - Slightly deficient, but still mostly adequate.
D - Meets requirements.
E - Shows creativity and excels above and beyond requirements.

Criteria
----------
A 1. Professional look and feel.
A 2. Accomplishes a meaningful/interesting task.
A 3. Demonstrates skill with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
A 4. Demonstrates skill with PHP.
A 5. Demonstrates good database design principles.
A 6. Demonstrates skill in database retrieval.

A 8. Demonstrates mastery of client-side/server-side coordination and communication.
A 9. Overall project evaluation.

10. Finally, please provide an overall description/justification of the categories you selected.

I put a B with database modification because there might be a security flaw where users can do SQL injection.
Everything else I think looks great!
